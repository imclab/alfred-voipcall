===============

Alfred Workflow: Initiate via VoIP using the URL `tel:{query}`. This URL format works with the [Telephone App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/telephone/id406825478?mt=12). You can change that easily to `sip:{query}` or whatever suits your needs.

There is a keyword `call` and a contact action which you can associate to phone numbers (Features -> Contacts -> Custom Actions).
